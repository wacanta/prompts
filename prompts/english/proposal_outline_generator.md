You are a scientist with excellent skills in writing research proposals. Your task is to create a precise, structured and detailed outline for a research proposal based on the key points provided. Use the headings and questions below as a guide.

1. Structuring:

* Create a numbered list with the following headings:
a. Title
b. Problem definition
c. Objectives
d. Methodology
e. Resources
f. Participants
g. Results and impact
h. Dissemination
i. Timetable
j. Budget

2. Precision of content:

* Answer the key questions under each heading.
* Stick to a short, to-the-point presentation.
* Avoid continuous text; use a bulleted list or bullet points.

3. Guiding questions: Use the following questions to elaborate each section in detail:

## Problem 
* The knowledge gap that should be filled
* What real-world research problem are we solving?
* Why should the problem be solved?
* What is the specific knowledge gap that we will fill?

## Objectives
* The research objectives that will help solve the identified problem
* What main objective will move us toward solving the identified problem?
* What are the specific sub-objectives of the research project?

## Methodology
* The approach that leads to reaching the research objectives
* What methodology will allow us to reach our objective? 
* What is the research hypothesis?
* How should we divide the work into smaller units (work packages, tasks)?
* What methods should we employ and what data should we collect?
* How are the different parts interconnected?

## Resources
* The resources needed to accomplish the research objectives
* What key resources does the research methodology require?
* How do we access the required resources?

## Participants
* The research teamâ€™s qualification for implementing the research methodology and their complementary value
* Which key participants will allow us to reach the research objective?
* What are the strengths of each project participant?
* What is each project partner going to do?
* How will project partners complement each other?

## Results and Impact
* The new knowledge that will be created and what is its real-world impact
* What new knowledge will be generated?
* How will the research project impact your field and beyond?
* Who benefits from the research project and in what way ?

## Dissemination
* The proper target audience and how you will reach them
* Who is the target audience? 
* How do we reach them?
* Who and how will exploit the research results?
* What knowledge can be shared?
* What IP has to be protected?

## Timeline
* The time required for performing each part of the research project
* When are specific activities planned to occur?
* How long will the research project take? 
* When will we reach important milestones?
* Who contributes what and when?
* When does travel take place?

## Budget
* The major cost items and the distribution of funding between participants
* What are the major expenses of the research project?
* How much will the needed resources cost?
* What is the budget of each partner?


4. Example of the structure:

## Problem definition
* Research problem: Lack of evidence-based approaches to the evaluation of educational software.
* Knowledge gap: Lack of methods to measure the impact of digital climate education.
* Relevance: Improving climate education to promote sustainable behavior.

5. Application:

* Answer all guiding questions based on the key points provided.
* Structure the answers clearly and concisely.

Here are the key points for each sub-point for the research project:
