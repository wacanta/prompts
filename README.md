### Current Prompts

#### Prompt Generator
This prompt converts vague task descriptions into clear, detailed instructions. It creates a comprehensive prompt that assigns a role, outlines step-by-step actions, lists assumptions, and includes follow-up questions while proposing a specific output format for clarity. The assumptions and follow-up questions are only needed to help you refine the prompt iteratively. Once you are happy with a prompt you can copy it except the part about assumptions and follow-up questions. 

#### Task Decomposition
This prompt instructs the assistant to break down a complex task into smaller, manageable subtasks. Each subtask must include a clear description, specific instructions, required inputs and outputs, constraints, and an assigned role for execution, resulting in a systematic task roadmap.

#### Proposal Outline Generator
This prompt directs the assistant to generate a structured outline for a research proposal. Using a numbered list with predefined sections (e.g., Title, Problem Definition, Goals, etc.), it answers guiding questions concisely in bullet point form.

#### Grant Requirement Analysis
This prompt instructs the assistant to compare specific sections of a project proposal with the requirements of a grant call. It identifies alignments and discrepancies and offers concrete improvement recommendations, with the final output structured as a table.

#### Assess Research Relevance
This prompt directs the assistant to analyze detailed information (hypothesis, methodology, and results) from a second research project. It then extracts key insights that support the relevance and value of a first research project. The analysis is output in a structured table format.

#### Critical Text Assessment
This prompt tasks the assistant with critically evaluating a section of a project proposal. It examines clarity, logic, relevance, and coherence; identifies weaknesses like ambiguities or missing details; and provides improvement suggestions in bullet point format.

#### Scope Literature Search
This prompt requires the assistant to identify key search terms for a comprehensive literature review based on a given research question and methodology. It organizes terms into categories—such as theoretical concepts, similar studies, current debates, and methodological approaches—in bullet points.

#### Scope Literature Search Iteratively
This prompt guides the assistant to conduct an iterative literature search process. Initially, it asks clarifying questions about the research focus, context, and methodology, then provides a structured summary including disciplinary perspectives and interdisciplinary search queries.

#### Simple Literature Analysis
This prompt instructs the assistant to perform a detailed analysis of a research paper by extracting its hypotheses, methodology, and results along with corresponding text excerpts. The final analysis is formatted as a JSON object.

#### Storytelling Tactics
This prompt directs the assistant to select and justify an appropriate storytelling tactic for a research paper, then write a first draft text (up to 300 words) using that tactic. It also asks for follow-up questions to refine the approach further.

#### Writing Style Improvement
This prompt tasks the assistant with enhancing a given text by identifying and addressing repetitive phrases, improving clarity and professionalism, and suggesting ways to clarify ambiguous passages. The output is organized under descriptive headings.
