# ðŸ“˜ Living Research Agenda Template

_A guided template for exploratory and focused literature review_

---

## Initial Spark or Interest

**What motivated you to explore this topic?**  
(This could be a question, observation, experience, or curiosity.)

> _Example: I noticed companies increasingly use AI in hiring, and I wonder how fair or biased these systems are._

---

## Broad Topic Area

**Describe your main area of interest in 1â€“2 sentences.**  
(Aim for clarity over precision â€” this will evolve.)

> _Example: I'm interested in algorithmic decision-making in the context of recruitment and its ethical implications._

---

## Clarifying the Topic: Subtopics & Dimensions

**Break your topic into key components or themes you want to understand.**  
_You may not know all of them yet â€” this helps clarify what to look for._

* Subtopic / Dimension     
* Why is it important?                         

---

## Refining Research Questions

**Draft 1â€“3 research questions based on what you know so far.**  
(These will evolve â€” start where you are.)

> _Example: How do AI hiring tools affect fairness in candidate selection?_

---

## Connecting to Existing Research Themes

**What broader academic conversations or themes might this connect to?**  
(e.g. fairness in AI, HR tech, digital labor, bias in algorithms)

### Theme 
Explanation: 

---

## Mapping What You Know (vs. What You Donâ€™t)

* Area / Subtopic          
* What seems well-covered in the literature? 
* What feels unclear or underexplored? 

---

## Tentative Research Gap(s)

**Based on the above, what gaps are you starting to see?**  
_Even if unsure â€” use this to track your evolving understanding._

> _Example: While there are many studies on algorithmic bias, fewer focus on how job applicants perceive fairness._

---

## Tentative Hypothesis

**Based on the above, what hypothesis would you generate?**  
_Even if unsure â€” use this to track your evolving understanding._

> _Example: AI biases may be perceived as more unfair as those by humans._

---

## Methodological Reflections

**How might you investigate your topic (if applicable)?**  
(Not every project needs a method yet â€” but reflecting on this can help narrow the scope.)

- Possible method(s):  
- Possible sample/population:  
- Kind of data (qualitative/quantitative):  
- Challenges or limitations:

## Offshoot Ideas & Tangents

**Track ideas or spin-off topics you discover during exploration.**  
(Some may become new inquiry templates later.)

* New Idea / Sub-Interest     
* Related to main topic? 
* If existing: Link to new template

## Current Literature Review

**Write a brief summary of what you understand now. Then, list your current questions.**

> _Summary:_  
>  
> _Current Questions:_  
> 1.  
> 2.  
> 3.
